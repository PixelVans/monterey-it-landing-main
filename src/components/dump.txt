3. Services Sentence: Remove break-fix language

Current

From remote or on-site computer repairs to full managed IT solutions ...

Replace with

From network and device management to security, monitoring, and long-term IT planning, we take
ownership of your technology so it works quietly in the background.

This directly communicates:
· proactive
· ongoing responsibility
· less interruption-based


4. Primary CTA: De-emphasize urgency, emphasize assessment
Current buttons
. Call Now

Get Help Now

Replace with
· Request an IT Assessment
. Talk With an IT Advisor

You can still keep a phone number visible, but these CTAs reinforce consultative entry, not emergency
support.

for this part,


6. Metrics Row: Adjust framing

Current
. 20min Response Time
. Issue-centric metrics

Replace with
· 500+ Businesses Managed
99.9% Uptime Target
. Long-Term Client Retention (or Avg. Client Tenure)
If you keep response time at all, demote it visually.

7. Optional Tagline (Small but Powerful)
Under the main headline, add a subtle line:
Not a helpdesk. A long-term IT partner.

This directly addresses the positioning problem without ambiguity.







1. Section Intro Copy (Biggest Problem Area)

Current

delivers dependable computer repair and managed IT support
Whether you need immediate help or want to prevent problems ...

This sentence alone resets the visitor's brain to:
· break/fix
· emergency-driven
· ticket-based IT

Replace with

delivers proactive IT management and technology systems designed to support small and mid-sized
businesses. We focus on prevention, stability, and long-term reliability - not just fixing problems after
they occur.

This keeps:
· small business focus
. local trust
while removing:
·"computer repair"
. "immediate help" framing


2. Card 1: "Fast, Local Support" > Reframe to Responsiveness Without Helpdesk Vibe

Current title

Fast, Local Support

Replace with

Local, Responsive IT Management

Current body

On-site or remote help with response times under 20 minutes ...

This is pure helpdesk language.

Replace body with

Proactive monitoring and local expertise when needed. Our team is based in Monterey County and
stays close to your systems, not just your support tickets.

You still imply responsiveness, but without "call us when broken."

3. Card 2: Pricing Is Fine - Minor Framing Adjustment
This card is mostly okay.

Current title

Transparent, Upfront Pricing

Keep it.

Body tweak
Replace:

honest diagnostics

With:

clear scopes and defined service coverage

"Diagnostics" implies break/fix. "Scope" implies managed services.


4. Card 3: "Small-Business Focused" > Strong, Keep but Sharpen
This one is directionally correct.

Current title

Small-Business Focused

Optional upgrade
Built for Small & Growing Businesses

Body tweak
Replace:

Tailored IT solutions without enterprise-level pricing.

With:

Right-sized IT systems and management without unnecessary enterprise complexity or cost.

This reinforces intentional simplicity, not cheapness.


5. Optional Micro-Tag Above Cards (Very Effective)
Add a single line above the three cards:

Designed for businesses that want IT handled, not constantly dealt with.

This sentence does a lot of positioning work quietly.
